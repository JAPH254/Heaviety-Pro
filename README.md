## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:JAPH254/Heaviety-Pro.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the necessary environment variables:
     ```env
     DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     DJANGO_DEBUG=True
     DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
     DB_NAME=your_db_name
     DB_USER=your_db_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_PORT=5432
     ```

5. Run migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser to access the Django admin:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Start the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## API Endpoints

The Heaviety backend exposes several RESTful API endpoints for managing users, products, and categories.

- **User Registration**: `POST /auth/users/`
- **User Login**: `POST /auth/jwt/create/`
- **User Profile**: `GET /auth/users/me/`
- **Product Management**:
  - `GET /api/products/` - List all products
  - `POST /api/products/` - Add a new product
  - `PUT /api/products/{id}/` - Update product details
  - `DELETE /api/products/{id}/` - Delete a product
- **Category Management**:
  - `GET /api/categories/` - List all categories
  - `POST /api/categories/` - Add a new category

---

## Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. This will start both the backend and frontend services, and the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` for the backend and `http://localhost:5173` for the frontend.
